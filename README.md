Harmonia is a dapp that allows eos users to match the memes in their minds.

Harmonia 

I have a theory with three parts.

Most people are good.
Conflict arises from contradicting memes.
A harmonious society can be built through discovering these contradictions and replacing wrong memes with true memes. 

Harmonia is a game for thoughtful people who are interested in discovering the specific memes that they hold in their brains and that they pass onto others.

Memes are like viruses in the mind. 

Memes spread across and infect entire populations.

In the digital age memes spread more quickly.

Some memes are truthful and some memes are not truthful.

The trouble is that when we have an untruthful meme in our head we think it’s true!

Harmonia, the game seeks to explore in depth exactly what memes that people hold in their brains and how they may contradict or complement memes in other people’s brains… 

Often, one brain can hold several contradicting memes.

A good example would be the ‘My Body My Choice’ meme. This meme has been used by the Pro Choice movement for decades. But the meme is now being used by people like me who are don’t want an experimental drug jabbed into my arm… But how can a pro-life anti-vax person say “My Body My Choice” without his mind braking? How can a pro-abortion and pro vaccine mandate supporter say “My Body My Choice” without breaking her mind? 

Above is just an example of one meme.

I think that there are hundreds and I want to build a small team of researchers to catalog these memes by pulling them out of our own brains one by one.

Harmonia will start with the population of Eden on EOS! 

21 randomly selected volunteers from our Eden community will be invited to join a special telegram channel where we hash out all of the common memes that people on earth believe.

Once we think we have a complete list we will start to test the theory…(1) Most people are good. (2) Conflict arises from contradicting memes. (3) A harmonious society can be built through discovering these contradictions and replacing wrong memes with true memes. 

Where does the ‘game’ part come in?

OK once we have whittled down the list of memes we can create the game.

Harmonia will be a card game both in the physical world and on the EOS blockchain.

Let’s talk about the blockchain version first. 

Each meme will be an NFT. Players will be sent the full deck of Harmonia NFT meme cards into their eos player account.

To play most effectively, a player first reads each of the entire meme deck.

Then the player chooses what to do with each card; hold it, grok on it, or burn it.

Hold: Meme cards that are held by a player are those that he for certain believes in.
Grok: these are meme cards that a player needs to think about more before he knows if they are true or false.
Burn: these are the meme cards that a player is absolutely certain are wrong. 

Now comes the interesting part… the harmonEOSness-ness-ness… 

A coder (who will receive a huge chunk of the Pomelo grant!) will code a little contract to compare the results of any two players in a browser.

We’ll call this smart contract the ‘Value Congruency Engine’. 

The output of the Value Con… STOP! that’s too long so let’s just call it Harmonia.

The output of the Harmonia dapp will simply display three numbers:

Number of memes that two players HOLD in common.
Number of memes that Bob holds that Alice BURNED.
Number of memes that Alice holds that BOB burned.

Please note that I am just developing this concept and I am open to any improvements!

Now for the physical Harmonia meme card game.

Not everyone even online, nevermind using blockchains yet. 

It is also true that old codgers have some pretty darn good memes in their minds and this thinking game may be fun to introduce to family and friends to just see what the output is.

I picture simple black cards with white writing on them.

To play, the player simply sorts the cards into three piles; yes, maybe, and nope.

A pad of Score Sheets is also provided with the game for players to write down the meme cards that they hold.

Note that I am very open to iterations making this game more fun. I am a self analytical person and I think that Harmonia is a fun-ish game as is but I am sure that it can be improved.

Why Support Harmonia?

Harmonia can be an important tool for self discovery and improving our minds
Harmonia might allow people to understand each other better.
Harmonia might help people find similar thinking humans and organize into phyles.
